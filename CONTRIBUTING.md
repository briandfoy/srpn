# Contributing to srpn

This is mostly a for-fun project for me. I'm happy to take corrections
and additions as long as it doesn't get in the way of me playing with
it. I don't intend to significantly support this for external use.

Raise an issue or send a pull request if you like, but if you want to
make big changes, a fork might be more appropriate.
